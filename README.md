<p>
Software Engineer specialized in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Big Data making an expertise as Data Scientist and Data Engineer (Full Stack Data Scientist or AI & ML Engineer).

Eager to learn and explore the synergies between Math, Computer Science and Data and how they apply to solve real world challenges.
  
  The repositories you'll see here are mostly for my learning journey towards a new career in data science and data engineering or simply fulfilling my personal quest for knowledge. The repositories in my secondary account are used for teaching a course about DevOps.

### ðŸ’¼ Where I Currently Work ðŸ’¼

[Capgemini Engineering](https://capgemini-engineering.com/us/en/): Machine Learning Engineer, AI & Data Consultant

- Developed Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) project, based on Python, and AWS Sagemaker, with data versioning using Feature Stores, models versioning in Model Registries, and history tracking of experiments and deployments.
- Increase marketing campaigns sales rates by analyzing data from large scale databases and developing Machine Learning models in Python with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow and resilient predictive services to serve them.
- Facilitated the serving and CI/CD workflows of an optimizer engine to optimize the scheduling of factories processes by containerizing and building a microservice with Docker to deploy it in Kubernetes.
- Increase team productivity and code quality by creating a guide consolidating good development, documenting, and testing practices, applying DevOps principles, and developing a Python library to abstract Machine Learning workflows. 
- Designed the architecture and operationalization of microservices for a Federated Machine Learning platform with Django, Mlflow and Apache Airflow.
- Contributed to AWS SageMaker SDK to facilitate the use of Feature Stores.
- Conducted a talk about MLOps with AWS in a conference

### ðŸ“š What Currently I am studying ðŸ“š

I am a master student in Artificial Intelligence in the University of Applied Sciences, Germany.
*As this takes most of my time, in addition to working the learning paths below got stopped.*

### ðŸ“š Currently Working and Learning More About:


* [Python library](https://github.com/JoseJuan98/scratchNN) for building simple Deep Neural Networks from scratch, using only vectorized operations with NumPy to develop further understanding in the inner workings of neural networks and provide a foundation for building a Production-ready Python library.

* [Showcase project](https://github.com/JoseJuan98/CaliforniaHousingCensusCase) to demonstrate my Machine Learning Engineer and Consultant skills in all the cycles of a project of this kind.

* Bayesian Statistics, primarily through the book [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919), and some articles that you can find in [towards datascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/). At the moment this is [my progress](https://github.com/JoseJuan98/Statistical_Rethinking_Exercices)


* Time Serie Anlysis (**finished**), I am mainly using any source that I find interesting from this [repository](https://github.com/cuge1995/awesome-time-series#Theory-Resource) which contains a lot of sources to learn. Unluckly, any project related with TSA cannot be shown as there are used in my job :( .

* Neural Networks and Deep Learning (**finished**), by the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) of Coursera, and I have been enjoying being exposed to Linear Algebra and Deep Learning. [My progress](https://github.com/JoseJuan98/DeepLearning_Projects) (First course, finished)

* Data Engineering with Apache Spark and Delta Lakes (**finished**). Acquiring a [Data Engineer Professional Certificate](https://academy.databricks.com/data-engineer) from Databricks. I enjoy data modeling and creating data pipelines to support Data Science projects.


### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on

Open source projects related to Environmental Intelligence to help to preserve nature or evaluate the state of it.
