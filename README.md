<p>
  I'm a software engineer and junior data engineer and scientist who is passionate about learning and solving problems in collaborative and international environments. 
  
  The repositories you'll see here are mostly for my learning journey towards a new career in data science and data engineering or simply fulfilling my personal quest for knowledge. When I'm not coding you can find me at the mountains hiking, taking a walk through the city or reading about Psychology, Economy, History, Sociology or Politics. </p>
