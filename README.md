### ðŸ“š What Currently I am studying ðŸ“š

I am a master student in Artificial Intelligence in the University of Applied Sciences, Germany.
*As this takes most of my time, in addition to working the learning paths below got stopped.*

### ðŸ“š Currently Working and Learning More About:

* Time Serie Anlysis (**finished**), I am mainly using any source that I find interesting from this [repository](https://github.com/cuge1995/awesome-time-series#Theory-Resource) which contains a lot of sources to learn. Unluckly, any project related with TSA cannot be shown as there are used in my job :( .

* Neural Networks and Deep Learning (**finished**), by the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) of Coursera, and I have been enjoying being exposed to Linear Algebra and Deep Learning. [My progress](https://github.com/JoseJuan98/DeepLearning_Projects) (First course, finished)

* Bayesian Statistics, primarily through the book [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919), and some articles that you can find in [towards datascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/). At the moment this is [my progress](https://github.com/JoseJuan98/Statistical_Rethinking_Exercices)

* Data Engineering with Apache Spark and Delta Lakes (**finished**). Acquiring a [Data Engineer Professional Certificate](https://academy.databricks.com/data-engineer) from Databricks. I enjoy data modeling and creating data pipelines to support Data Science projects.

* Distributed and GPU solutions for data processing and ML/DL. Learning about Python libraries like Ray, Dask, TensorFlow, CuDF, CuML, CuPy, Numba, ... and learning how to make my own cluster of computers.

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on

Open source projects related to Environmental Intelligence to help to preserve nature or evaluate the state of it.
