<p>
 Software Engineer specialized in data-solutions making an expertise as Data Scientist and Data Engineer.
Eager to learn and explore the synergies between Math, Computer Science and Data and how they apply to solve real world challenges.
  
  The repositories you'll see here are mostly for my learning journey towards a new career in data science and data engineering or simply fulfilling my personal quest for knowledge. The repositories in my secondary account are used for teaching a course about DevOps. 
  
  When I'm not coding you can find me at the mountains hiking, taking a walk through the city, or reading about Psychology, Economy, History, Sociology, or Politics. </p>

### 💼 Where I Currently Work 💼

[Capgemini Engineering](https://capgemini-engineering.com/us/en/): Data Engineer

### 📚 What Currently I am studying 📚

I am a master student in Artificial Intelligence in the University of Applied Sciences, Germany.
*As this takes most of my team, in addition to working the learning paths below got stopped.*

### 📚 Currently Working and Learning More About:

* Time Serie Anlysis (**finished**), I am mainly using any source that I find interesting from this [repository](https://github.com/cuge1995/awesome-time-series#Theory-Resource) which contains a lot of sources to learn. Unluckly, any project related with TSA cannot be shown as there are used in my job :( .

* Neural Networks and Deep Learning (**finished**), by the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) of Coursera, and I have been enjoying being exposed to Linear Algebra and Deep Learning. [My progress](https://github.com/JoseJuan98/DeepLearning_Projects) (First course, finished)

* Bayesian Statistics, primarily through the book [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919), and some articles that you can find in [towards datascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/). At the moment this is [my progress](https://github.com/JoseJuan98/Statistical_Rethinking_Exercices)

* Data Engineering with Apache Spark and Delta Lakes (**finished**). Acquiring a [Data Engineer Professional Certificate](https://academy.databricks.com/data-engineer) from Databricks. I enjoy data modeling and creating data pipelines to support Data Science projects.

* Distributed and GPU solutions for data processing and ML/DL. Learning about Python libraries like Ray, Dask, TensorFlow, CuDF, CuML, CuPy, Numba, ... and learning how to make my own cluster of computers.

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on

Open source projects related to Environmental Intelligence to help to preserve nature or evaluate the state of it.
